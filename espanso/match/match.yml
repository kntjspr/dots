      Thanks for reaching out! I'd be happy to take this on. 
      I've reviewed the requirements and it fits my schedule.

      Hi {{name}},
      
      Thank you for thinking of me for this project.
      Unfortunately, I'm fully booked for the next few weeks and won't be able to give this the attention it deserves.
      
      I can recommend a few other developers if you'd like.
